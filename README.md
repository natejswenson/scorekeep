## 🏆 Why This Exists

Look, I love volleyball. But I hate ads. Especially when I'm trying to keep track of a close match and suddenly there's a 30-second unskippable ad about car insurance.

This app is for players, by players. No ads, no premium subscriptions, no "unlock the ability to count past 10" nonsense. Just pure, simple scorekeeping.
