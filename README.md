# 🏐 ScoreKeep

> **Because volleyball is too awesome for ads!** 🚫📱

## What's This All About?

Fed up with scorekeeping apps that show you ads every time you want to bump, set, or spike your way to victory? Yeah, me too! 😤

ScoreKeep is a clean, ad-free, volleyball-focused scorekeeping app that gets out of your way and lets you focus on what matters: **the game**.

Whether you're playing beach volleyball at sunset 🌅, dominating the court at your local gym 🏟️, or settling family disputes in the backyard 🏡, ScoreKeep has your back.

## ✨ Features

- **🔴 Red vs 🔵 Blue** - Classic team colors that work in any lighting
- **👆 Tap to Score** - Large, easy-to-hit score areas (perfect for sweaty fingers)
- **➖ Minus Buttons** - Because everyone makes mistakes (except that one ref 🙄)
- **🔄 Reset Button** - Start fresh for the next set
- **📱 Mobile First** - Works great on phones, tablets, whatever you've got
- **🌐 Web Compatible** - Runs in your browser too
- **🚫 Zero Ads** - Because nobody wants to see a mattress commercial mid-rally

## 🏆 Why This Exists

Look, I love volleyball. But I hate ads. Especially when I'm trying to keep track of a close match and suddenly there's a 30-second unskippable ad about car insurance.

This app is for players, by players. No ads, no premium subscriptions, no "unlock the ability to count past 10" nonsense. Just pure, simple scorekeeping.
