- Component rendering
- State management logic
- Utility functions
- Score calculation logic
- Local storage operations

#### Integration Tests
- Component interaction
- Data flow between components
- Storage integration
- Navigation flow

#### End-to-End Tests

## 3. Architecture Design

### 3.1 Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React Native (cross-platform)
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage
- **Testing**: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- **E2E Testing**: Detox
- **Development**: Expo (for rapid development and local testing)

### 3.2 Component Architecture
```
App
├── GameScreen (main scoreboard)
│   ├── TeamCard (x2)
│   ├── ScoreControls
│   └── GameActions
├── SettingsScreen
│   ├── TeamSettings
│   ├── GameSettings
│   └── ColorPicker
└── HistoryScreen
    └── GameHistory
```

### 3.3 State Structure
```typescript
interface AppState {
  game: {
    team1: Team;
    team2: Team;
    scoreIncrement: number;
    winCondition: number;
    isGameActive: boolean;
    winner: string | null;
  };
  settings: {
    soundEnabled: boolean;
    vibrationEnabled: boolean;
  };
  history: GameRecord[];
}

interface Team {
  name: string;
  score: number;
  color: string;
}
```

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Scoring (Week 1)
**Goal**: Basic two-team scoring functionality

#### Tests to Write:
```javascript
describe('Core Scoring', () => {
  test('should display initial scores of 0-0');
  test('should increment team score when tapped');
  test('should decrement team score when minus button pressed');
  test('should not allow negative scores');
  test('should reset both scores to zero');
});
```

#### Components:
- GameScreen component
- TeamCard component
- Basic score state management

### Phase 2: Team Customization (Week 2)
**Goal**: Team names and colors

#### Tests to Write:
```javascript
describe('Team Customization', () => {
  test('should update team name');
  test('should change team color');
  test('should persist team settings');
  test('should load saved team settings');
});
```

#### Components:
- SettingsScreen component
- TeamSettings component
- ColorPicker component

### Phase 3: Game Configuration (Week 3)
**Goal**: Configurable game rules

#### Tests to Write:
```javascript
describe('Game Configuration', () => {
  test('should set custom score increment');
  test('should detect winner when win condition met');
  test('should display winner notification');
  test('should prevent further scoring after win');
});
```

#### Features:
- Configurable score increments
- Win condition logic
- Winner detection and display

### Phase 4: Data Persistence (Week 4)
**Goal**: Save/load game state and history

#### Tests to Write:
```javascript
describe('Data Persistence', () => {
  test('should save game state to storage');
  test('should restore game state on app launch');
  test('should save completed games to history');
  test('should display game history');
});
```

#### Features:
- AsyncStorage integration
- Game history tracking
- State persistence
